# Comment: Automatically start screen. But only one time
# Comment: Connect to old session if it exists.
# Comment: Allows multiply views of one session.
# Comment: The problem is we get called recursively: first login->bash
# Comment: and the screen calls bash again.

# 1. are we in screen or are we login' in ?
if [ -z "$STY" ]; then # login in
   # check for existing screen
   /usr/util/bin/screen -x
   if [ "$?" -eq 1 ]; then    # no screen running
      /usr/util/bin/screen -q # start a new screen
   fi   
else  # screen starts us
   /bin/bash --login
fi

# don't keep on being in normal login shell
exit
